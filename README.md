# NoisyJS
A fun little sketch in p5js inspired by Daniel Shiffman (@shiffman)'s coding challenges

This project was based on the work of and inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](http://twitter.com/shiffman) 
(and [@shiffman](http://github.com/shiffman)) and his series of JavaScript and 
p5js tutorials on Youtube videos under the name [The Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website)

I couldn't find the code for this on GitHub because the link was broken, so I just cloned it and pushed it to GitHub myself (ahh) I hope that is ok. 
If it isn't please tell me so I can take this down.
